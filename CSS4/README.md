We have two images for you to style, each with two class names, where one of the class names is shared. The goal here is to chain the selectors for both elements, so that each have a unique style applied, despite using a shared class selector. For example, you want an element that has both X and Y to have one set of styles, while an element with X and Z has a completely different set of styles. We included the original images as well, so that you can see how the styles you will be adding look in comparison, so do not add any styles to them.
